# Test Results - Automated Run

This document summarizes the outcome of the automated test commands executed in the Codex environment.

## `npm test`
- **Status:** Failed
- **Reason:** Puppeteer attempted to navigate to `http://localhost:8080/tests/manual/test_lang.html` but the connection was refused. The local PHP server required for the tests was not running.

## `vendor/bin/phpunit`
- **Status:** Not executed
- **Reason:** `composer` is not installed in the environment, so `vendor/bin/phpunit` is missing. Installing dependencies via `composer install` is required before running PHPUnit.

## `python -m unittest tests/test_flask_api.py`
- **Status:** Failed
- **Reason:** The `flask` module was not found. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` before running the Python tests.

## Suggested Adjustments
1. Install project dependencies:
   - Run `npm install` to fetch Node packages (already done in this run).
   - Ensure `composer` is installed, then run `composer install` for PHP dependencies.
   - Install Python packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Start a local PHP server on port 8080 before executing Puppeteer tests:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8080
   ```
3. Run the test suites in the order described in `docs/testing.md`.
