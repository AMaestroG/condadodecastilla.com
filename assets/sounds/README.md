# Sound Assets

The menu open/close audio files are not stored in this repository to keep the repository size small.

Download the following files and place them in this directory:

- `menu-open.mp3` – <https://example.com/audio/menu-open.mp3>
- `menu-close.mp3` – <https://example.com/audio/menu-close.mp3>

Once downloaded, the menu toggle sound effects will play correctly.
